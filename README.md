# Flower-Species-Classification

## Overview

The Flower Species Classification project is a machine learning project that aims to classify flowers into three different species based on their features. This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, to create a model that can accurately predict the species of a given flower.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of flower samples, each labeled with one of three species: setosa, versicolor and virginica. The dataset contains a variety of features, such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width, which are used as input features for training the machine learning models.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Flower-Species-Classification.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
- scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- Jupyter Notebook (for code development)
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)
```

3. Open and run the `flower_species_classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to execute the code, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. You can use this trained model to classify flower species by providing input data with the relevant features.

## Results

The project's machine learning models have been trained and evaluated, and their performance metrics, such as accuracy and precision, are discussed in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Future Improvements

This project can be further enhanced by:
- Collecting a larger and more diverse dataset.
- Fine-tuning model hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
- Implementing deep learning techniques for image-based flower species classification.
